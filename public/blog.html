          The first week.  We were warned we would "jump right in" regarding the Iron Yard's approach.  They weren't kidding.
          We learn so much every day!  It's a lot of frustration.  You're new... to this school... to you're classmates...
              to code.  The pre work helps, you're at the very least with the terminology and some of the concepts.  What
              it doesn't prepare for you though is the pacing.  The assignments are challenging and sometimes feel overwhelming.
              However, at the end of the week while working on our weekend assignment it's incredible to realize how much progress
              has been made in ONE week!

          This is where all the real fun begins right???  We've been doing daily JS in the mornings during stand ups to
          prepare us for this week so it will not feel so daunting when we get to this portion of the cirriculum.  Our
          assignments changed this week as we were doing tests instead of building pages.  The test are difficult it feels
          awesome when you finally solve that problem and see the test turn green.  Everyone in class has felt the struggle
          a little this week.  This is a big hurdle to jump over and it's exciting to incorporate JS into our future
          assignments

        It's week 7.  It' hard to believe how fast time is going by.  It's incredible to look back and see how much more
        complex the projects we are working on compared to when we started.  It's really cool to be able to actually interact
        with your work.  We've been introduced to various frameworks now and I have found it really interesting seeing
        how different frameworks operate and work in conjuction with one another.  So far we have been working with Adonis
        and Vue.  Both seperately and together.  Sometimes it can be a little confusing when keeping track of whats going
        on and where, but seeing the different things you can do and integrating those things into our projects has been very
        enlightening
